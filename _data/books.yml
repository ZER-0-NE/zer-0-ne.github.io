    Quang Duc setting himself on fire and then just sitting there like a boss. Most
    modern Westerners know of meditation as a relaxation technique. You put on some
    yoga pants and sit in a warm, cushy room for ten minutes and close your eyes and
    listen to some soothing voice on your phone telling you that you’re okay, everything’s
    okay, everything’s going to be fucking great, just follow your heart, blah, blah,
    blah. But actual Buddhist meditation is far more intense than simply de-stressing
    oneself with fancy apps. Rigorous meditation involves sitting quietly and mercilessly
    observing yourself. Every thought, every judgment, every inclination, every minute
    fidget and flake of emotion and trace of the assumption that passes before your
    mind’s eye is ideally captured, acknowledged, and then released back into the
    void. And worst of all, there’s no end to it.People always lament that they’re
    “not good” at meditation. There is no getting good. That’s the whole point. You
    are supposed to suck at it. Just accept the suckage. Embrace the suckage. Love
    the suckage.

- summary: This book has structure. Lots of it. She effectively creates a language
    of her own, a juvenile lucid language which complements the wistful mood of the
    book beautifully. The plot moves around in space and time with masterful ease
    and one can't help but experience a vague sense of foreboding, a prickly fear
    in the back of your neck. From what could have been just another tragic incident,
    Arundhati Roy weaves a poignant story about the loss of innocence and the far-reaching
    devastation caused in the aftermath of one tragic event. She examines every character
    with a genuine warmth, their motivations, insecurities and most importantly, their
    unfulfilled dreams, the definitive universal human tragedy. 'The secret of being
    a bore is to tell everything.' Voltaire said. This book is an appropriate example
    of how true that adage is. Like a loving mother with only one piece of pie, she
    withholds information and doles it out at the most opportune moments, yet never
    does the plot become incomprehensible. In fact, we lap it all up and can't wait
    for the next serving. To even attempt to summarize the plot would be to take everything
    away from it because, well, surprise!, the book really _is_ about the **Small
    Things**. And the **Really** **Big** **Things**.
