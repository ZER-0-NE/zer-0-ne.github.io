    Quang Duc setting himself on fire and then just sitting there like a boss. Most
    modern Westerners know of meditation as a relaxation technique. You put on some
    yoga pants and sit in a warm, cushy room for ten minutes and close your eyes and
    listen to some soothing voice on your phone telling you that you’re okay, everything’s
    okay, everything’s going to be fucking great, just follow your heart, blah, blah,
    blah. But actual Buddhist meditation is far more intense than simply de-stressing
    oneself with fancy apps. Rigorous meditation involves sitting quietly and mercilessly
    observing yourself. Every thought, every judgment, every inclination, every minute
    fidget and flake of emotion and trace of the assumption that passes before your
    mind’s eye is ideally captured, acknowledged, and then released back into the
    void. And worst of all, there’s no end to it.People always lament that they’re
    “not good” at meditation. There is no getting good. That’s the whole point. You
    are supposed to suck at it. Just accept the suckage. Embrace the suckage. Love
    the suckage.
